Mutation Fallback Pipeline
==========================
When SAAGA exhausts all attempts on a defense scenario, this module
takes the best-scoring failed attack, generates N mutated variants using
JailGuard's structure-preserving text mutators, and provides them for
re-execution against the victim LLM.

Scoring: Uses judge-independent `fallback_score` from `best_attack_data`.
The DistilBERT judge is NOT relied upon — only keyword signals and
extractor results are used.

Mutator pool (default): SR (Synonym Replacement, WordNet-backed, offline),
PI (Punctuation Insertion, offline), TL (Translation, local NLLB-200 offline).
These preserve the attack's meaning while changing its surface form.

TL (Translation) is offline-capable via a local NLLB-200-distilled-600M model
(lazy-loaded once per process, CPU). It produces a one-way EN->X translation; the
variant goes to the victim in the foreign language so the defense's English
pattern-match misses it. If NLLB weights are absent on the node, TL no-ops
(returns the seed); pre-download NLLB on a login node before offline runs.

Excluded: RR (Random Replacement), RD (Random Deletion), RI (Random Insertion),
TR (Targeted Replacement), TI (Targeted Insertion) — these corrupt structured
payloads (base64, XML, JSON) and are counterproductive for offensive fuzzing.

    """Batch-across-scenarios mutation fallback.

    Identical semantics to run_mutation_fallback, but instead of issuing one
    victim query per failed scenario, it concatenates ALL jobs' round-1
    variants into ONE chat_fn query and ALL round-2-eligible jobs' variants
    into one more. The victim vLLM has large concurrency headroom (~6.87×);
    an 8-conv per-scenario query underfills it, and B scenarios issuing B
    sequential queries serialize through that headroom. One big batched query
    amortizes the victim's prefill/decode across all concurrent scenarios.

    Each job is a tuple: (best_attack_data, scenario, extractor). Returns a
    list of MutationFallbackResult, one per job, in submission order — so the
    caller can zip(jobs, results) and attribute wins per scenario exactly as
    the single-scenario path does. Round count is unchanged (max 2); only the
    victim-query grouping changes. Per-scenario success attribution, mutator
    attribution, no-op flags, and round-2 re-seeding are all preserved.

    Args:
        fallback:      MutationFallback instance (holds config).
        jobs:          List of (best_attack_data, scenario, extractor) tuples.
        chat_fn:       Callable[[list[list[dict]]], list[str]] — victim batch query.
        strip_fn:      Callable[[str], str] — strips few-shot artifacts.
        pool_resolver: Mutator-pool resolver (see run_mutation_fallback).

        List[MutationFallbackResult], one per job, in submission order.
